Hi CDT developer, just a few words to descript some of the things in this app.

### Things to impress:

- DataTable is a reusable componet, padding in data and headers to make the table
- I use axios with some rxjs to amend the object before sending to the datatable
- I'm using redux to handle state
- I use mostly scss but some material ui to handle the dialogs
- I tried my best to do unit tests, I found unit tests hard with dispatching actions with Redux, I am nearly 60% coverage of unit tests.
- I use Typescript
- I use an infiniteScroll to load items when user scrolls down to the bottom of the page.
- I am editing the table rows a click event to that row it opens a dialog with prefilled data, you can then edit those values and press submit.
- The app is responsive.

It was fun to do, I hope to get some feedback. I am keen to work and contribute to a team, and learn more skills in FrontEnd, especially with TDD and Testing in general.
